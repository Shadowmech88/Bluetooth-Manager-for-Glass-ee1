Bluetooth-Manager-for-Glass
===========================

Easily add and remove Bluetooth devices from Google Glass. No need for the Settings.apk anymore.

Requires Android Studio 0.5.3+.

Built with Glass Developers Kit (GDK) Preview, Android API 19, revision 4.

The Enterprise Edition 1 does not support voice triggers that aren't part of the VoiceTriggers.Command enum, so this version has been tweaked to remove the voice command and instead launch via an app launcher.
