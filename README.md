Bluetooth-Manager-for-Glass
===========================

Easily add and remove Bluetooth devices from Google Glass. No need for the Settings.apk anymore.

Built with Glass Developers Kit (GDK) Preview, Android API 19, revision 4.

The Enterprise Edition 1 does not support voice triggers that aren't part of the VoiceTriggers.Command enum, so this fork has been tweaked to remove the voice command and instead launch via an app launcher.

For future reference, this was compiled using [Android Studio 2.3.2.0](https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/install/2.3.2.0/android-studio-bundle-162.3934792-windows.exe).
